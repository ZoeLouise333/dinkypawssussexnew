                      Being back in the office a few days a week, we needed to
                      find a dog walker for our puppy and I am so glad we went
                      with Dinky Paws. Zoe has been walking our puppy twice a
                      week and the service she provides is brilliant! We get a
                      comprehensive update every time she completes a walk along
                      with pictures from the walk, and Zoe has been so patient
                      when things haven‚Äôt gone according to plan, which with a
                      puppy happens fairly often! (coming in to find puppy has
                      chewed his harness or been sick etc). She has also been
                      actively training our puppy to walk calmly on the lead and
                      we have noticed a massive improvement in his behaviour and
                      response to other dogs which has been a wonderful bonus!!
                      We cannot recommend Zoe and Dinky paws enough üòä

                      Brilliant! I was recommended to contact Zoe - what a great
                      recommendation. Unfortunately we couldn't do the meet and
                      greet, but Zoe turned up and took my 3 springers out. She
                      was mindful of the heat (it was scorching), she took them
                      for a short walk and kept them in the shade. I will
                      definitely use Zoe again. If my dogs are happy, I'm happy.

                      Zoe‚Äôs communication is always so thorough and professional
                      (and usually followed by a couple photos of our dog

                      Zoe looked after my spoilt cat whilst we were on holiday
                      for a week. We really wanted someone who would spend time
                      with our older cat and give him lots of attention. Zoe
                      went above and beyond during her visits. She even offered
                      to help with watering our plants and closing and opening
                      curtains. Zoe spent lots of time with our cat and I really
                      enjoyed getting updates everytime she visited ( with
                      photos). After using a well known larger company
                      previously who only spent 3 minutes with our cat (
                      observed on our ring camera) I was reassured that Zoe was
                      spending a good amount of time giving our cat lots of fuss
                      ( 30 quality minutes üôÇ ).It was lovely to know he was
                      being so well cared for. I would highly recommend Zoe for
                      pet sitting, she clearly loves animals.
